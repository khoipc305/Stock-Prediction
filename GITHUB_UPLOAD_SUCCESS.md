## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### **If deployment fails:**

1. **Check build logs** in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. **Verify files:**
   - `app.py` exists
   - `requirements.txt` correct
   - Model file uploaded
3. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   py -m streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Check file paths** - should be relative, not absolute

### **If predictions still wrong:**

1. **Verify you pushed latest code:**
   ```bash
   git log -1
   # Should show: "Add stock prediction deployment app with fixed LSTM predictions"
   ```
2. **Check predictor.py** has the fix
3. **Re-deploy** if needed
